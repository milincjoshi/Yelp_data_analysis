Here are a few comments on homework 1:

- Your question must be _specific_.  Broad question is difficult to conduct data analytic.  What's it can lead you down a path that is not tractable.  The result can be disastrous.

- Your question must third order in nature.  To be in third nature:
  - It must answer the `why` question.  In other words, your data analytic answers or explains the observation or assumption, or
  - It must perform some kind of prediction.  E.g. Given this condition can we predict a certain outcome.

- For those who answers first and order knowledge questions, it's not helpful and can put you in danger of not passing the course.

- A few of you do the following:
  - Taxi/uber prediction (our recommendation: don't do it -- pick something else)
  - Sports analytic (our recommendation: don't do it -- pick something else) 
  - Stock prediction (our recommendation: don't do it -- pick something else)

Ultimately it's up to you.  However, picking any of these three will receive extra scrutiny because someone is doing it, sports analytic is hard (borderline gambling), and stock prediction is a pipe dream.
